(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile again.

   You will also need to load JParsec.fs. Do this by typing
   #load "JParsec.fs" 
   in the interactive environment. You may need the entire path.

   Do not remove the module declaration (even though that does work) because you may inadvertently
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find if you want
   to switch back to project mode. 

   Alternative, keep the module declaration as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment

(* Question 2.1: Types, names and behaviour *)

    (* 
    
    Q: What are the types of functions foo, bar, and baz?

    A: foo : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list option
       bar : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list
       baz : string -> string -> string


    Q: What do the function foo, bar, and baz do.
       Focus on what they do rather than how they do it.

    A: foo goes through the two lists if the elements are the same (at each index) and returns Some plus the remainder of 
       xs if it as long as or longer than ys. In all other cases it returns None.
       
       bar returns a list of xs excluding parts that are equal to the whole ys list. Thus it removes ys from xs.
       
       baz removes b from a if b is a substring of a and returns the resulting string.
    
    Q: What would be appropriate names for functions 
       foo, bar, and baz?

    A: foo : removeSublistAux
       bar : removeSublist
       baz : removeSubstring
        
    *)
        

(* Question 2.2: Code snippets *)

 
    (* 
    The function baz contains the following three code snippets. 

    * A: `[for c in a -> c]`
    * B: `[for c in b -> c]`
    * C: `List.fold (fun acc c -> acc + string c) ""`

    Q: In the context of the baz function, i.e. assuming that `a` and `b` are strings, 
       what are the types of snippets A, B, and C and what are they -- 
       focus on what they do rather than how they do it.
    
    A: A returns 'a' as a list of chars. 
       B returns 'b' as a list of chars.
       C takes a list of chars and returns it as a string. All the snippets keep the order of the string/list.
    
    Q: Explain the use of the `|>`-operator in the baz function.

    A: the '|>' operator takes the output from the previous function (in this case the result of calling bar) and pipes 
       it into the following function as the last parameter (in this case the list for the fold function).

(* Question 2.3: No recursion *) 

    let foo2 xs ys = 
        let l = List.length xs
        let ly = List.length ys
        if l < ly
        then None
        else
            let prefix,rest = List.splitAt ly xs
            if (prefix = ys) then Some rest else None

(* Question 2.4 *)

    (*

    Q: The function `bar` is not tail recursive. Demonstrate why.
       To make a compelling argument you should evaluate a function call of the function,
       similarly to what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and reason about that evaluation. 
       You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the function 
       is not tail recursive. Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation chain must 
       evaluate to the same value ( (5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27 , for instance).
       
       You do not have to step through the foo-function. You are allowed to evaluate 
       that function immediately.
